This position can be based out of San Francisco, New York, or remote (we accept candidates from many states).

We're looking for Software Engineers to join our Payments Core organization to lead growth and adoption of global and domestic payment rails.

You'll be at the forefront of ensuring our payments platform is highly scalable, adaptable, and reliable.

The core platform at Modern Treasury sits between our customers and their banks. In the same way that Twilio abstracted away the complexity of working with communication networks, we have built an easy-to-use, common interface into the banking system. Our customers use our products to do things like move money to or from their users, automate back-office work, and record their transaction ledgers. The companies that can use Modern Treasury move over $750 trillion a year via bank payments, as compared to only $2 trillion per year on card payments.

In this role, you'll directly impact the evolution of our payments product. Your work will shape the future of instant payments, allowing businesses to move money faster and across borders. Experience working with international payment systems is a plus, but success in this role will require creativity and a willingness to learn the details of these payment systems beyond our borders.

• Collaborate with our product team to scope and ship products for our enterprise users.
• Participate in shaping our roadmap, particularly around scaling and refining payment rail workflows.
• Help grow our team by mentoring new engineers, writing internal tooling and documentation, and interviewing new hires.

WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
• 5+ years of professional software engineering experience

• Experience with U.S. domestic and/or global payment rails (ACH, Wires, Swift, RTP) and payments standards (ISO20022, NACHA, BAI)
• Experience working with SQL/Relational databases. Experience with batched payments is a plus.
• Experience mentoring and growing engineering, as well as contributing to technical direction
• Creative problem-solving skills and a willingness to learn the nuances of both domestic and international payment systems.

------------------


At Cube we are building a technology stack for modern analytics. If you are fascinated by the software that powers large technology companies but want the challenges and freedom that come with working in a small startup, then the job at Cube is for you. We are a small and dedicated team in San Francisco, funded by top\-tier SV investors, working on making advanced analytics infrastructure developed at large tech companies accessible to all developers around the world.

**Position**
------------


As an engineer of the Cube Core team, your main goal will be to build and maintain various parts of open\-source Cube Core (**https://github.com/cube\-js/cube.js** (https://github.com/cube\-js/cube.js)), community support in our Slack, as well as development of Cube Cloud product.


### **Some of the problems you'll be working on:**


* **SQL generation and rewriting.** Cube is a simple yet powerful way to organize SQL queries. The Cube way is to generate the best possible SQL query for a given database while abstracting all complex stuff from users and giving them full power of SQL at the same time. To solve this problem, Cube parses SQL queries written by users to understand the structure and rewrites them to apply performance optimizations.
* **Cube Store.** Cube Store is used to serve analytics for trillions of data points with sub\-second response times. To keep up\-to\-date with growing big data demands and serving speeds we're developing our own database optimized for serving huge aggregated tables with latencies of several milliseconds.
* **Cube APM.** One of the main tech problems for Cube Cloud is to provide APM analytics of Cube instances using Cube itself. Being purely a dog food problem, large\-scale real\-time analytics has a lot of challenges, most of which will be solved for the first time ever using the SQL approach.


### **Requirements:**


* Expert in database algorithms and data structures: columnar vs row storage, SQL parsing, query planning, indexes, partitioning, join algorithms, filter pushdown optimizations, HLL.
* Expert in Rust, or any other low\-level language.
* Good communication skills.
* Fluent English.
* Previous startup experience or interest in working in a small fast\-moving company.


### **Bonus points:**


* Expert in data structures and data processing algorithms.
* Expert in at least one of the high\-level VM languages such as Node.js, Ruby, Python, Java, Scala, C\#, or similar.
* Experience in building and managing high\-load analytical or data infrastructure applications.
* Experience with Docker and k8s, AWS, GCP.
* Experience with contributing to or the maintenance of an open\-source project.
* Development experience with JavaScript, React, Node.js would be a plus

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in\-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays \& Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

  

**About The Role**
 The Web Presence team is building Notion's front\-facing website—the first thing users see when they visit notion.so. As an engineer on the team, you'll own the technical foundation of this dynamic and reliable website. You'll collaborate with product managers, designers, writers, and content creators to bring their visions to life. A successful candidate will lead in creating and maintaining a website that tells a clear story about the product, captures people's attention, increases overall traffic and signups.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Deliver an end\-to\-end marketing site experience that's accessible, reliable, performant, and optimized across multiple geographies
* Understand the Notion customer by identifying key points in their journey and uncovering insights to drive engagement and signups
* Plan, shape, and build new features that create a more engaging and personalized experience, telling a compelling story to our audiences
* Work across the entire stack, from Vercel, Cloudflare, and NextJS to React, HTML, and CSS


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Shipping polished user interfaces: You have 3\+ years of engineering experience building and maintaining quality user interfaces for a big audience. You are comfortable using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript (we use TypeScript), and a modern UI framework like React and NextJS. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
* Thoughtful problem\-solving: For you, problem\-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
* Pragmatism and impact\-orientation: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
* Putting users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
