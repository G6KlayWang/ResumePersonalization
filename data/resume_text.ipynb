    "2. A plausible educational background that matches the candidate's experience timeline and professional level. The background should make sense. For example, if the resume suggests about 5 years of working experience up until 2018 as a database administrator, the candidate likely completed their undergraduate degree at least 7-10 years prior (e.g., completed a Bachelor's degree around 2010-2012 if that fits). If they are highly experienced (10+ years), they might have completed education even earlier. The degree should align with their field (Computer Science, Information Technology, Software Engineering, etc.). Include:\n",
    "   - The name of a top 200 globally ranked university (e.g., Stanford, MIT, Oxford, Cambridge, University of Toronto, ETH Zurich, National University of Singapore, etc.).\n",
    "   - The degree (Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD) and the major.\n",
    "   - Attendance years that align reasonably with their career timeline. For instance, if the resume indicates they've been working as a database admin since 2010, maybe they graduated with a Bachelor's around 2007-2009.\n",
    "   - If they have extensive experience and advanced roles, consider they might have a Master's degree as well. But do not overcomplicate. If the candidate seems mid-level, a Bachelor's might suffice.\n",

    "3. A realistic and professional-looking email address (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo), ensuring the email address is some randomly combinations of numbers and letters\n",

    "4. A random city in the United States as their current location (e.g., Seattle, Chicago, Boston).\n",
