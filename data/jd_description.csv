"**ABOUT US**


Synthesize Bio is an early stage startup using generative AI to fundamentally change life sciences research and accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.


Genomic data are at the heart of most modern molecular studies and tools, from basic research to clinical decision support, but these data are hard to work with. Genomic data require expensive laboratories, sophisticated computational infrastructure, and big teams to produce and analyze. Generating and analyzing genomic data takes weeks or months. We're building generative AI models to cut that time down to minutes or hours.

* Experience deploying, evaluating, and testing, or otherwise supporting, GenAI applications and their components (e.g., LLMs, Vector DBs, etc.)



*Don't meet every single qualification? Studies show people are hesitant to apply if they don't meet all requirements listed in a job posting. If you feel you don't have all the desired experience, but it otherwise aligns with your background and you're excited about this role, we encourage you to apply. You could be a great candidate for this or other roles on our team.*

Your qualifications will be evaluated based on your application materials (e.g., resume, supporting documents), your responses on the application questionnaire, and your responses to all assessments required for this position.

"Pit.AI Technologies is taking on one of the most exciting challenges of our time, namely solving intelligence, in one of the most competitive industries ever, investment management!



The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter\\-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.



We adopt a finance\\-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is *truly* saying.



We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co\\-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee \\& Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

  

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI\\-Quants.

  

This role is an ***in\\-house mathematician*** role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

  

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real\\-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed\\-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype\\-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

  

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

  

We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

 **Requirements:**


* Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
* Excellent graduate\\-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
* Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.
* No finance or machine learning experience is required."

"**ABOUT US**


Synthesize Bio is an early stage startup using generative AI to fundamentally change life sciences research and accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.


Genomic data are at the heart of most modern molecular studies and tools, from basic research to clinical decision support, but these data are hard to work with. Genomic data require expensive laboratories, sophisticated computational infrastructure, and big teams to produce and analyze. Generating and analyzing genomic data takes weeks or months. We're building generative AI models to cut that time down to minutes or hours.


Our platform addresses a huge need in the large and rapidly growing use of genomics in research, from basic science to therapeutic development. mRNA therapeutics alone \\- a subset of the overall market we serve \\- is projected to be a $100 billion market by 2026\\. This is an opportunity to be part of a mission to transform life sciences R\\&D by dramatically accelerating the pace of discovery.


**WHO WE ARE**


Our team has dedicated their careers to moving the needle in biomedical research and education and has a deep understanding of how to build a transformative product in this space. Our founders each have \\~20 years of experience in life sciences, genomic data generation and analysis, and AI/ML and data science. Our team has leading experts in the design, execution, collection, and application of AI/ML methods to large biological studies; has previously led and scaled startups; and are experts in scientific training and enablement. We have lived the problem and are ready to solve it!


**WHAT YOU'LL DO IN THIS ROLE**


We are looking for a (senior) bioinformatics data engineer who wants to join our mission and be an early part of building our AI\\-powered platform at the intersection of machine learning and life sciences discovery. As an early member of the team, you'll have significant opportunities to shape both the technical stack and the company's long\\-term direction.


You will help build out our data and bioinformatics architecture, including:


* Be foundational in the development of the roadmap for scalable, efficient, and future\\-proof data and bioinformatics infrastructure
* Collaborate across all our technical teams (Data, AI, and Platform) to develop data solutions that enable all teams. For example, improving performance and access to our training database (10s of millions of samples) for training our AI models
* Implement new and improve existing data processing pipelines with an emphasis on automation, lowering costs, and improving robustness


**TYPICAL QUALIFICATIONS**

**Software Engineer \\- Platform Productivity**
----------------------------------------------


### **About our Platform (at Grafana Labs):**



Grafana Cloud moves millions of metrics, log lines, and traces per second from our customers' environments into a highly available, low\\-latency stack that processes and stores these data, and serves them to dashboards and alerting tools. We aim to grow this to hundreds of millions per second, and it's critical that as we grow, we improve our performance, increase our reliability, and, of course, do it efficiently and effectively.

  



The Internal Engineering Platform delivered by the Platform department provides application engineers with the tools, systems and Kubernetes clusters they need to build, deploy and run their workloads. Platform roles at Grafana Labs have an eye for engineers with a passion for performance and reliability, and who enjoy taking projects from conception to production. We organize ourselves into squads to allow focus on Cloud Infrastructure, Networking and Security; engineering Productivity; Capacity management, Client Administrative Tooling (CAT); and US Federal compliance.

  



Because we deploy production services, we have on\\-call rotations to ensure the health of the system. Everyone at Grafana Labs tries to incorporate and use our product line up into their day\\-to\\-day, so being on call is an important way to understand our system and how people use our products.

  


### **About the squad \\& the role:**



We are hiring for the Platform Productivity squad. The squad is mostly responsible for helping our internal engineers release their software onto our infrastructure, in secure and measurable ways. They lead automation of the release processes (anywhere from CI/CD to bootstrapping) and help our internal engineering teams get on board with them using ‘golden path’ techniques, but also helping edge cases and making sure that teams can get the most out of our tools.

  



At the end of the day, we’re the Platform Team for the teams that are building some of the most cherished observability tools– from Grafana, Mimir and Loki, to Tempo.

  


### **Who Are We Looking For?**



You enjoy working with engineers, as well as with the management structures that are there to support you and enable you and your team to do your very best.

  



You are **comfortable working in a remote\\-first company**; communication is key. For us, working together means being collaborative, friendly, kind, and respectful. We operate by consensus, you can contribute to a discussion but then commit to the team decision.

  



You are eager to **learn and grow**. There is a lot of room for growth and development, and the team has quite a lot of knowledge to share for those who are wanting to learn.

  



You approach development holistically. The team owns the full life cycle of our code; from writing design docs, looking at developer feedback, testing and deployment, all the way through to decommissioning. We appreciate engineers who enjoy looking at the big picture, and also notice the details of the brush strokes. You're a flexible software engineer. In a typical day, we might spend time responding to incidents, integrating existing systems, or designing and implementing our own systems. While our primary language is Go, we value flexibility and we'll choose the best tool for the job, even if that is a shell script.

  



You have experience with **operating your code**. Since a lot of operators and developers use our software, having some grounding in both of these spaces really helps us with building better platforms for our users. Kubernetes and Docker are what we use, mostly. We also work with a lot of Infrastructure as Code, so be sure to check out grafana/tanka.

  


### **Responsibilities**



The squad is responsible for setting its own roadmap, and as a part of the team you'll have a part to play in that process. You'll help us maintain, improve and extend what we already have. You'll be involved in choosing what we focus on next and, just as importantly, when and how to gracefully sunset systems which are no longer needed. Your responsibilities will also include helping the team to design, compare, and choose appropriate solutions for (at least some) of the following things:


* Development and maintenance of our Internal Engineering Platform (IEP)
* CI/CD platform management and development
* Build, release and deployment automation
* Application configuration management tooling
* “Up to date” software automation
* Artefact management
* Working with diverse internal teams, from application development to security, to support implementation of their requirements
* Being part of an on\\-call rotation to support Platform tooling

  


### **Some skills/experience we like to see:**


* Engineering/software development experience within a Platform group delivering services to internal engineering teams
* Experience working in a cloud environment
* Infrastructure as Code with Terraform/Crossplane.
* Familiarity with Kubernetes administration \\- very cool if experience with Tanka.
* Experience/Interest in implementing, integrating, and maintaining observability systems and processes

  


### **A few of our upcoming projects:**


* Development of our next gen CI/CD systems
* Development of productivity tooling/automation in our IEP portal (Backstage)
* CI/CD observability
* Development of security automation as part of our CI/CD systems


In the United States, the Base compensation range for this role is USD $123,933 \\- $148,719\\. Actual compensation may vary based on level, experience, and skillset as assessed in the interview process. Benefits include equity, bonus (if applicable) and other benefits listed here.

This position can be based out of San Francisco, New York, or remote (we accept candidates from many states).

Our goal is to expand into new markets and add support for local payment rails in EMEA, LATAM, and APAC. You'll be at the forefront of ensuring our payments platform is highly scalable, adaptable, and reliable.

The core platform at Modern Treasury sits between our customers and their banks. In the same way that Twilio abstracted away the complexity of working with communication networks, we have built an easy-to-use, common interface into the banking system. Our customers use our products to do things like move money to or from their users, automate back-office work, and record their transaction ledgers. The companies that can use Modern Treasury move over $750 trillion a year via bank payments, as compared to only $2 trillion per year on card payments.

In this role, you'll directly impact the evolution of our payments product. Your work will shape the future of instant payments, allowing businesses to move money faster and across borders. Experience working with international payment systems is a plus, but success in this role will require creativity and a willingness to learn the details of these payment systems beyond our borders.

During your first six months, you will:
• Lead a project that improves performance and payment workflows across multiple payment rails.
• Collaborate with our product team to scope and ship products for our enterprise users.
• Participate in shaping our roadmap, particularly around scaling and refining payment rail workflows.
• Help grow our team by mentoring new engineers, writing internal tooling and documentation, and interviewing new hires.

WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
• 5+ years of professional software engineering experience
• Experience collaborating with product teams to design features and customer-centric workflows that meet customer needs.
• Experience with U.S. domestic and/or global payment rails (ACH, Wires, Swift, RTP) and payments standards (ISO20022, NACHA, BAI)
• Experience working with SQL/Relational databases. Experience with batched payments is a plus.
• Experience mentoring and growing engineering, as well as contributing to technical direction
• Creative problem-solving skills and a willingness to learn the nuances of both domestic and international payment systems.

TECHNOLOGIES WE USE
• Ruby on Rails for our backend framework
• Postgres for our database
• Redis for caching
• AWS for infrastructure and hosting

**You Have:** 



* Bachelor's degree and 5\\+ years' relevant work experience or an equivalent combination of education and experience.
* Strong software engineering fundamentals and experience developing production grade software; experience with Python, Golang, or similar language preferred.
* Working knowledge of cloud\\-based services as well as their capabilities and usage; AWS preferred.
* Expertise with IaC tools and patterns to provision, manage, and deploy applications to multiple environments (e.g., Terraform, Ansible, Helm).
* Experience with DevOps or GitOps practices and tools (e.g. GitHub Actions, ArgoCD)
* Familiarity with application monitoring and observability tools and integration patterns (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Splunk, DataDog, ELK).
* Familiarity with containerization as well as container management and orchestration technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
* Ability to work collaboratively in a team environment.



 Bonus:
 


* Expertise in designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting large\\-scale distributed systems and/or working with accelerated compute (e.g., GPUs).
* Experience working with machine learning applications and associated frameworks/tools, particularly for monitoring and observability.
* Experience with big data technologies, distributed computing frameworks, and/or streaming data processing tools (e.g., Spark, Kafka, Presto, Flink).
* Experience deploying, evaluating, and testing, or otherwise supporting, GenAI applications and their components (e.g., LLMs, Vector DBs, etc.)



*Don't meet every single qualification? Studies show people are hesitant to apply if they don't meet all requirements listed in a job posting. If you feel you don't have all the desired experience, but it otherwise aligns with your background and you're excited about this role, we encourage you to apply. You could be a great candidate for this or other roles on our team.*
